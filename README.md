MIPS processor in Logisim with build tools

This project intends to simulate a MIPS-IV-compatible processor using
Logisim (http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).  I started working on this
in 2010 while I was "virtually attending" a computer science class from
UC-Berkeley via podcast.

Documentation of the MIPS instruction set and architecture can be
found by searching Google for "MIPS Green Sheet" and for "mips-iv.pdf".
