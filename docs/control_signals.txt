Meanings of the various control signals, since I forget easily...

ExtOp - zero-extend the operand
RegDst - normally write to register selected by rt.  When RegDst, use rd.
RegWr - signal to write a register, otherwise no write
MemWr - writing to memory, otherwise no write
Mem2Reg - when high, memory goes into a register.  Otherwise, ALU output
ALUsrc - Normally, ALU input comes from BusB.  When high, comes from a possibly-extended immediate in the instruction
branch - a branch instruction
jump - a jump instruction
ALUctr - 6 bits used to select the ALU function

rs - register select into BusA, usually used as an input to the ALU
rt - register select into BusB, which can be 2nd input to ALU, or data written to memory
